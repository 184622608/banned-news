### 给美国总统川普的一封求救信
------------------------

<p>【大纪元2018年09月22日讯】编者按：北京市法轮功学员<a href="http://www.epochtimes.com/gb/tag/%E8%92%8B%E7%AB%8B%E5%AE%87.html">蒋立宇</a>于2016年5月11日在石景山区张贴法轮功真相贴纸，被当地警方非法抓捕，关押在北京市石景山看守所。2018年7月12日蒋立宇被石景山法院秘密宣判4年，罚款5,000元。2018年9月17日蒋立宇被北京市第一中级法院非法二审宣判，维持原判。在接下来的一个月里，蒋立宇将被送往武汉女子监狱。</p>
<p>下文是<a href="http://www.epochtimes.com/gb/tag/%E8%92%8B%E7%AB%8B%E5%AE%87.html">蒋立宇</a>的姐姐<a href="http://www.epochtimes.com/gb/tag/%E8%92%8B%E7%82%BC%E5%A8%87.html">蒋炼娇</a>，在妹妹二审期间向美国<a href="http://www.epochtimes.com/gb/tag/%E5%B7%9D%E6%99%AE.html">川普</a>总统写的求救信。经蒋炼娇授权，公开此信，内容有删减。目前，她还在期待川普总统的回信。</p>
<h4>尊敬的<a href="http://www.epochtimes.com/gb/tag/%E5%B7%9D%E6%99%AE.html">川普</a>总统：</h4>
<p>您好！感谢您百忙之中阅读我写给您的这封信。我是来自中国大陆的女孩，法轮功学员<a href="http://www.epochtimes.com/gb/tag/%E8%92%8B%E7%82%BC%E5%A8%87.html">蒋炼娇</a>。</p>
<p>现在，我在中国的家人们，他们也是法轮功学员，正遭遇更为严峻的困境，我不得不向您发出请求：希望得到您和美国政府的帮助。</p>
<p>我的妹妹蒋立宇（26岁），因在北京石景山区张贴“天安门自焚伪火”（2001年由中共央视一手导演的，专门诬蔑法轮功的事件）真相传单，于2017年5月13日遭北京市石景山广宁派出所非法抓捕，经石景山检察院非法批捕后，送审石景山法院。</p>
<p>在7月份，妹妹遭石景山法院一审非法判刑4年，罚款5千，现在我帮助她上诉。</p>
<p>就在妹妹被非法判刑的同时，我爸爸蒋启祥（64岁）突然中风，左半边身子不能动。从那时起，只有妈妈乔良玉（54岁）一人能照看他。</p>
<p>大姐远嫁，且刚生完孩子，无法回家照看父母；哥哥因还贷不敢辞掉工作无法回家。</p>
<p>就我个人而言，我根本无法回国。</p>
<p>目前正需要妹妹回家照顾爸爸，可是⋯⋯实际上，她被非法关押。这对我们家来说是雪上加霜。</p>
<p>我期盼得到您的帮助，希望在不久的将来接纳我到贵国，让我能够为妹妹的事情呼吁。</p>
<p>此前，曾了解到您伸手帮助一些被中共关押的中国人权律师家属，还帮助他们实现抵美的心愿。您的善良和慷慨令人十分钦佩。</p>
<p>所以，我多么希望能得到您的帮助。如果可能，期盼您帮助我们远离中共的迫害，一个从曾祖父辈就遭受中共迫害的家庭。</p>
<p>我的曾祖父，因为信仰道教，在文化大革命时期，遭批斗致疯，最后含恨而终；父亲（儿时目睹自己的爷爷被批斗）仅因信仰法轮功遭非法判刑、劳改、劳教多次，母亲亦如此。</p>
<p>而且，被关监狱的那段受迫害经历，让爸爸身体（腿被打断，瘦弱无比，差点被打死）、心理（处于非常害怕的境况）受到极大的伤害，当时差点死在监狱。</p>
<p>因中共“一胎化”政策，为了躲避罚款，妹妹和我从小就被藏在亲戚家抚养。当妹妹8岁，我9岁时，我们四个孩子和父母一起到北京天安门为法轮功而呼吁。我们却亲眼见到中共警察殴打父母。</p>
<p>当时，我们全部被抓进天安门广场的警车上。我，一个9岁的女孩，甚至被电棒打昏过去。</p>
<p>从此，我们家就没有平静过，警察不断地去骚扰。在父母双双被关押期间，晚上的时候，我们几个孩子被反锁在家，还吃不饱饭。在我十岁的时候，因为没有父母的保护，我被邻居男生强奸。这种身体和精神的伤害与痛苦，对我和我的父母来说，无以言表。</p>
<p>在和妹妹上学的每一个阶段，从小学到大学，我们的父母都曾被非法劳教或者被送往洗脑班。最近，因为明慧网（法轮功网站）公布了父亲中风的消息，当地警察和父亲的单位（湖北省十堰市鲍峡镇中心医院）领导又一次去骚扰父母。</p>
<p>中共迫害法轮功长达19年，至今未停。我们家庭4代人遭受中共的迫害，是一封信无法涵盖的。</p>
<p>我很难想像接下来的4年，我父亲的身体状况会如何；更令人伤心的是，若妹妹真被判刑4年，她出狱时，已经30岁了。不要说全家何时能团聚。</p>
<p>所以，恳请您帮助我和我的家人：要求北京市石景山法院、石景山看守所无罪释放我妹妹蒋立宇；也请求您能一同推动、结束中共对法轮功学员的迫害。</p>
<p>只有这样，千千万万个中国良心犯（主要是法轮功学员）才能真正获得自由，免于被活摘器官。</p>
<p>衷心祝愿您和您的家人健康快乐！我相信，通过支持正义、坚持传统价值观，美国将比以往任何时候都更加强大，就像您在就职演说中所说的那样。</p>
<p>此致</p>
<p>敬礼</p>
<p>蒋炼娇</p>
<h3>Honorable President Trump,</h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">First of all, thank you so much for reading this letter, written by an ordinary Chinese girl.</span></p>
<p>My name is Lianjiao Jiang(蒋炼娇), a 27-year-old Falun Gong(also called Falun Dafa)practitioner from mainland China.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">As something very serious is happening to my family in China, who are also Falun Gong practitioners, I have to urgently seek help from you and the U.S. government.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">My younger sister Liyu Jiang (蒋立宇, 26 years old) was illegally arrested by the Guangning Police Station and Procuratorate of Shijingshan District, and then detained in a detention center in Shijingshan District, Beijing, since May 13, 2017, just for putting up a sticker clarifying the truth about the “Tiananmen self-immolation hoax.”The incident was directed in 2001 by CCTV, the mouthpiece of the CCP, to slander Falun Dafa.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">In late July, the Shijingshan Court made a decision at her trial and she was given a four-year prison sentence and a fine of 5,000 RMB Yuan. I am planning to appeal for her case.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Just after my sister was illegally sentenced, my 64-year-old father Qixiang Jiang (蒋启祥) suddenly had a stroke and the left half of his body lost mobility. For the time being, only my 54-year-old mother Liangyu Qiao (乔良玉) is available to look after him.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">My elder sister now lives far away after getting married, and as she just had a baby, she can&#8217;t look after my parents, and my elder brother can&#8217;t quit his job to go back to our hometown.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">In terms of myself, it is impossible for me to go back.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">My younger sister is urgently needed to take care of my dad, however, the fact that she is imprisoned is too cruel for the whole family to bear&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">I hope I can get your help to be resettled in the United States in the near future, so I can speak out to appeal for the release of my sister.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">I learned earlier that you lent your helping hand to several family members of those righteous Chinese human rights lawyers who were imprisoned, and made it possible for those family members to enter the United States. Your kindness and generosity is really admirable.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Therefore, I also hope to get your help if possible, based on the fact that my family has suffered from severe persecution under the CCP for 4 generations.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">My grand grandfather was driven insane as a result of torture during the Cultural Revolution for his belief in Taoism. He died shortly after that. My father, who had witnessed his grandfather being accused, was later illegally sentenced and sent to labor camps over and over again just for his faith in Falun Gong. (That&#8217;s also the case for my mother. )</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Furthermore, my father was terribly traumatized mentally and physically during his imprisonment: he endured horrifying beatings and both of his legs were broken, and he also suffered severe malnutrition and almost died in prison.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Because of the CCP’s &#8220;one child&#8221; policy, my sister and I had to be brought up secretly by relatives to avoid fines. When my sister and I were respectively 8 and 9 years old, we four kids went to Tiananmen Square to appeal for Falun Gong together with our parents and witnessed the CCP&#8217;s police brutally beat them.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">At that time, we were all caught into the police car parked on Tiananmen Square. Even I, a 9-year old girl, was stunned by the electric baton.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Our home has been frequently raided by the police since then. Us four kids were put under house arrest during the night for years, and could hardly get enough to eat when our parents were both illegally detained for their belief in Falun Gong. Without care and protection from my parents, as a young teen, I was raped by a teenage boy in the neighborhood. The physical and mental injuries inflicted on me and my parents are just beyond words.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">At each school stage of my sister’s and mine, from primary school to university, my parents had been imprisoned in brainwashing camps or detention centers. Recently, because the news of my father&#8217;s stroke was published on Minghui.org, a main Falun Dafa website, the local police and my father&#8217;s employer (Baoxia Town Central Hospital, Yun County, Shiyan City of Hubei Province) once again harassed my parents.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The CCP&#8217;s inhuman persecution of Falun Gong has been ongoing for more than 19 years. How four generations of my family have been harmed just can&#8217;t be contained in this letter alone.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">I can&#8217;t imagine how the health status of my father will decline 4 years later, when my sister, deprived of her youth, is finally set free in her 30s. Our family reunion is also beyond anticipation.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Hereby, I would like to ask for help from you and the U.S. government to urge the Court and the Detention Center of Shijingshan District, Beijing to acquit my sister Liyu Jiang, and also, help to bring the CCP&#8217;s persecution of Falun Gong to an end.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Only when this happens, will tens of thousands of prisoners of conscience (mainly Falun Gong practitioners) finally regain their freedom, and not be killed for their organs anymore on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">May joy and health be with you and your family. I do believe that by upholding justice and insisting upon traditional values, the United States will be stronger and greater than ever, just as you said in your remarkable inauguration speech.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Yours sincerely,</span></p>
<p>Lianjiao  Jiang</p>
